# LSDyna_FileRead
A C++ project to read an input file, parse its data, and write it in a desired format in an output file

In this exercise, C++ code is developed to read data from an LS-DYNA (.k) input file and write it into a text file. The goal is to search for a certain keyword in the input file and read the parameter values following the corresponding keyword’s name. On the output file, the keyword’s name is printed and is followed by a list of the parameters read from the input file.
